# 📊 Marketing Analytics Project (Google Sheets Edition)

This is my first data analysis project, done using **Google Sheets** and shared via Excel and Word. It focuses on understanding customer behavior and campaign effectiveness from a marketing dataset.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Discover how age, education, income, and family size affect campaign response.
- Identify the most responsive customer segments.
- Create pivot-based insights to guide marketing strategy.

## 📂 What's Included
- `marketing_data.xlsx`: Cleaned dataset with pivot tables
- `Marketing_Analytics_Summary_Report.docx`: Full analysis report with insights
- Visual pivot tables showing patterns in education, age, income, and response

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Highest responses came from graduate/basic-educated customers.
- Ages 35–50 are top spenders and most responsive.
- Customers with no or one child are more likely to accept offers.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Google Sheets (for data manipulation and pivot tables)
- Microsoft Excel (for exporting)
- Word (for reporting)

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Create data visualizations using Python or Power BI
- Automate similar analysis with Python or SQL
